[00:22.05] Who doesn't know what I'm talking about?
[00:27.45] Who's never left home? Who's never struck out?
[00:31.30] To find a dream and a life of their own
[00:37.36] A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone
[00:59.36] 
[00:43.70] Many precede and many will follow
[00:48.89] A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
[00:52.76] It takes the shape of a place out West
[00:58.18] But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed
[01:22.68] 
[01:03.57] She needs wide open spaces
[01:10.52] Room to make her big mistakes
[01:14.12] She needs new faces
[01:18.67] She knows the high stakes
[01:31.17] 
[01:26.27] She traveled this road as a child
[01:31.65] Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
[01:35.66] But now she won't be coming back with the rest
[01:40.81] If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test
[02:05.81] 
[01:46.27] She needs wide open spaces
[01:53.38] Room to make her big mistakes
[01:56.86] She needs new faces
[02:01.55] She knows the high stakes
[02:04.23] She knows the high stakes
[02:16.73] 
[02:30.24] And as her folks drive away, her dad yells, "Check the oil!"
[02:35.61] Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leavin' my girl"
[02:39.68] She said, "It didn't seem like that long ago"
[02:45.34] When she stood there and let her own folks know
[03:08.84] 
[02:50.39] She needed wide open spaces
[02:57.33] Room to make her big mistakes
[03:00.98] She needs new faces
[03:05.61] She knows the high stakes
[03:18.11] 
[03:08.36] She knows the highest stakes
[03:10.45] She knows the highest stakes (wide open spaces)
[03:16.56] She knows the highest stakes
[03:21.62] She knows the highest stakes (wide open spaces)
